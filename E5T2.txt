# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
CloudSploit, CFripper, Cloud Conformity

### Example vulnerability
- The default security group is often used for resources launched without a defined security group. For this reason, the default rules should be to block all traffic to prevent an accidental exposure.
- security groups set to "0.0.0.0/0
- KMS keys that don't have rotation enabled
- ELBs with invalid SSL configurations
- Misconfigurations in EC2, RDS, IAM, ElasticSearch, VPC, Redshift, SNS, and numerous other services.
- Compliance Standards including HIPAA, GDPR, CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, APRA, and MAS

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Anchore, trivy, snyk

### Example vulnerability
- can check an image/container to see if it has any known CVE vulnerabilities (i.e. Remote Code Execution, Information Exposure, Privilege Excalation, Cross-site Scripting)
- searches for secrets that may be contained with an image via a regex check (filename or content) i.e. AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, API_KEY
- Checking the USER instruction and making sure the effective user is not root
- Check for the existance of the HEALTHCHECK instruction is present within a Dockerfile
- Checks for an update instruction alone or in a single line (having this could deny a fresh update when it is built again)
- Only allow setuid and set gid permissions on executables 
- Check for the use of COPY instead of ADD instruction
- Verify the authenticity of packages before installing them in the image
- check for exposed port 22



##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
ScoutSuite, Prowler, CloudSploit, Zeus, Security Monkey

### Example vulnerability
Compute and Database external attack surface
GDPR Checks: 
Data Access Controls
-Fine granular access to AWS object in S3-Buckets: extra718 and extra725
-Fine granular access to SQS: extra727
-Fine granular access to SNS: extra731
-Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA): check12, check113, check114, extra71
-API-Request Authentication: this is about AWS API, entire IAM group1 may apply
-Geo-Restrictions (CloudFront): extra732
-Temporary access tokens through STS: extra733, probably a query to see if identity federation is configured?

Monitoring and Logging
-Asset-Management and Configuration with AWS Config: check25, check39,
-Compliance Auditing and security analytics with AWS CloudTrail: check21, check22, check23, check24, check26,check27,check35
-Identifications of configuration challenges through TrustedAdvisor extra726 show TA errors and warnings.
-Server access logs: this should be instances log? we can add service logs like extra714,extra715,extra717,extra719,extra720,extra721,extra722
-VPC-FlowLogs: check43
-AWS Config Rules: check25 already
-Filter and monitoring of HTTP access to applications with WAF functions in CloudFront: extra714 already

Protecting your Data on AWS
-Encryption of your data at rest with AES256 EBS extra729
-Encryption of your data at rest with AES256 S3 extra734
-Encryption of your data at rest with AES256 RDS extra735
-Centralized (by Region) managed Key-Management extra736
-IPsec tunnels into AWS with the VPN-Gateways. This is a security best practice, not an actual check.
-Dedicated HSM modules in the cloud with CloudHSM. This one may depend on each case, not an actual check

HIPPA Checks:
results of controls related to the "Security Rule" of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act aka HIPAA as defined in 45 CFR Subpart C - Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information

Trust Boundaries Checks
