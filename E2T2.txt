Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. CIS 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 :: resolve by modifying the security group and only allowing access from my IP address
2. c1-web-service-alb HTTP listener rule must have HTTP to HTTPS redirection action configured :: install a SSL certificate and turn on HTTPS redirection
3. S3 logs are not enabled for all the buckets created today :: enable S3 logs for all buckets
4. VPC - Checks whether default security group for VPC is closed :: remove the default security groups
5. No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-0e00204885a52cbac in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts. :: it is recommended that you configure all EC2 instances in your assessment target to require a level of password complexity. You can do this by using **pam_cracklib.so** "lcredit", "ucredit", "dcredit", and "ocredit" settings.
6.  Instance i-0e00204885a52cbac is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible. :: disable password authentication over SSH 
7.  Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-0e00204885a52cbac in your assessment target. :: To enforce minimum password lengths, set the “minlen” parameter of **pam_cracklib.so** in your PAM configuration.
8. Instance i-0e00204885a52cbac is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack. :: To disable SSH root account logins, set PermitRootLogin to 'no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd
9. On instance i-0e00204885a52cbac, process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet :: You can edit the Security Group sg-073e89e265dabfeb9 to remove access from the internet on port 68

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities. (remediations are above after ::)
